		<p>UMass Lowell has partnered with Rave Mobile Safety to provide an emergency alert system for students, faculty and staff called myAlert. The University will use myAlert to inform you about urgent or timely notices, such as weather delays/closures and health, environmental or criminal threats on campus. </p>
		<p>Since myAlert is a vital part of UMass Lowell campus security, you are encouraged to keep up-to-date contact information on file with Campus Police. This contact information remains completely confidential; UMass Lowell will use it to contact you only in the case of valid University business. </p>
		<p><b>How do I change myAlert notification preferences?</b></p> 
		<p>To manage your account and choose your notification preferences, please visit www.uml.edu/myAlert and login using your current UMass Lowell email address and password.</p>
		<p>At a minimum, alert messages will be delivered to your UMass Lowell email account. You can choose to add personal email addresses, as well as your landline and cell phone, to your notification preferences.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, please send an email to ENS@uml.edu or contact the Information Technology Help Center at ext. 4-4357.</p>
